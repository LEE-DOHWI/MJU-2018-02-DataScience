```

* [graphics task view at CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/
Graphics.html)

* 세 가지 주요 개념 : geoms, aestheic mappings, facetting

* + fine-tuning(customizing scales, theme)

* EDA vs. Model based Visualization!!!





# Testing
```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat <= 2) %>%
  mutate(
    lcarat = log2(carat),
    lprice = log2(price)
  )
diamonds2

xyplot(lprice ~ color | lcarat, diamonds2)

lcarat_ <- equal.count(diamonds2$lcarat, number=10, overlap=0)
diamonds2$lcaratCut <- cut(diamonds2$lcarat, breaks=10)
#t <- equal.count(diamonds2$lcarat, number=10, overlap=0)

xyplot(lprice ~ color | lcarat_, diamonds2)

xyplot(lprice ~ color | lcarat_ + cut, diamonds2)

xyplot(lprice ~ cut | lcarat_ + color, diamonds2)

diamonds2 %>% select(-color, -clarity) %>%
  group_by(cut, lcaratCut) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm=T) -> diamonds3

xyplot(lprice ~ cut | lcaratCut, diamonds3)
bwplot(lprice ~ cut | lcaratCut, diamonds2)
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
